^^ I don't see why......... people who want non prescription contact lens for cosmetic reasons to change their eye color dont really need any sort of medical prescription nor do people who buy VR headsets or VR glasses similar to hololens, even if they have a prescription required for glasses or not. With FDA approval guidelines I could understand if mojo.vision dealt with prescription lens only but if mojo.vision made a secondary contact under a type cosmetic guideline then it would pass if the contact lens was non prescription as a type of cosmetic altercation. remembering in the past about color contacts that are non prescription to change the color of the iris.

  Mojo Vision has developed prototypes for contact lenses that enable people to see augmented reality images as overlays on the real world. And now it has teamed up with Menicon, Japan’s largest and oldest maker of contact lenses, to further develop the product.

Saratoga, California-based Mojo Vision has developed a smart contact lens with a tiny built-in display that lets you view augmented reality images on a screen sitting right on your eyeballs. It’s a pretty amazing innovation, but the company has to make sure that it works with contact lenses as they have been built for decades. The partnership with Menicon will help the company do that, Mojo Vision chief technology officer Mike Wiemer said in an interview with VentureBeat.

“It’s a development agreement, and it could turn into a commercial agreement,” Wiemer said. “I’m very excited to work with them.”

Under the joint-development agreement, the two companies will work on various feasibility studies on production and manufacturing, exploring a potential long-term working relationship as Mojo tries to commercialize the technology.

Mojo Vision is developing Mojo Lens, which it calls the first true smart contact lens. Nagoya, Japan-based Menicon claims to be the only company in the world dedicated to all areas of contact lens-related business, including material development, lens designing, rigid gas permeable lens technology, manufacturing of lenses, and care solutions.

Areas of collaboration will center around contact lens materials, cleaning, and fitting, among other topics. Menicon, led by president Hidenari Tanaka, has been making contact lenses for 70 years, and it has more than 1,400 employees. Wiemer said that Menicon has volumes of research on things such as coatings for contact lenses and how devices interact with the human body.

“These are the challenges for us,” Wiemer said. “We have to get our teams to work together.”

Mojo Lens overlays monochrome images, symbols, and text on users’ natural fields of vision without obstructing their view, restricting mobility, or hindering social interactions.

Mojo is actively working with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) through its Breakthrough Devices Program, a voluntary program designed to provide safe and timely access to medical devices that can help treat irreversibly debilitating diseases or conditions.

In April 2020, Mojo announced it had raised more than $51 million in a funding round, and it has raised $159 million to date. The company has more than 100 employees. Financial terms of the agreement are not being disclosed. Wiemer said his company is developing relationships with most of the major contact lens companies, and that the company is working on a new prototype more advanced than the one it showed in January 2020.</p>

  Wireless smart contact lenses could be the answer to detecting diabetes and helping to treat diabetic retinopathy just by wearing them, researchers have said.

The technology, delivered by a team in South Korea, can successfully control drug delivery via electrical signals and could eventually see the end of finger-pricking.

The device relies on chip technology which monitors sugar levels via the users’ blood vessels behind the eyelids and will issue a warning should a health emergency arise.

A recent study showed the pioneering lenses correctly detected glucose levels from the tears of rabbits with diabetes.

In the last few years there have been many attempts to create contact lenses that could make life easier for people with diabetes.

In 2014, Google announced it was working on designing lenses that could measure blood sugar levels from tears. However, tests on the technology showed the measurements were inconsistent.

However, despite these latest exciting findings, lead researcher Professor Sei Kwang Han from Pohang University of Science and Technology’s (POSTECH) Department of Materials Science and Engineering, believes more research must be carried out before it can be made available to the general public.

He said: “Despite the full-fledged research and development of wearable devices from global companies, the commercialisation of wireless-powered medical devices for diagnosis and treatment of diabetes and retinopathy is insufficient.

“We expect that this research will greatly contribute to the advancement of related industries by being the first in developing wireless-powered smart contact lenses equipped with drug delivery system for diagnosis and treatment of diabetes, and treatment of retinopathy.”

The research has been published in the Science Advances journal.

# Possible type of application to download an electronic reciept by looking at it instead of using a camera phone app to import QR code image, since mojo technically can draw lines around objects to highlight them it could also draw lines around the pattern of a QR code image to decipher the pattern as a visual input or other QR objects for AR explanation as visual images or detailed packaging information outside of the use of reciepts. 

* As an example with other products like a food product a QR code could be identified by the contact lens and with wifi access from a phone it could draw a 3d floating interactive object explaining more detail about the product or other product type infozine, deals, or promotional information
